      "\n",
      "Answer without knowledge:\n",
      "\n",
      " Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent patterns of inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity that interfere with daily life and functioning. Symptoms can vary widely from person to person, but they generally fall into three categories: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Here are some common symptoms:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Inattention:\n",
      "1. **Difficulty staying focused and on task.**\n",
      "2. **Easily distracted, even with minor stimuli.**\n",
      "3. **Difficulty listening to others, even when spoken to directly.**\n",
      "4. **Frequently does not follow through on instructions or fails to finish tasks.**\n",
      "5. **Difficulty organizing tasks and activities.**\n",
      "6. **Avoids or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort.**\n",
      "7. **Often loses things necessary for tasks and activities.**\n",
      "8. **Easily sidetracked by extraneous stimuli.**\n",
      "9. **Forgetful in daily activities.**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Hyperactivity:\n",
      "1. **Fidgets with or taps hands or feet, or squirms in seat.**\n",
      "2. **Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected.**\n",
      "3. **Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is inappropriate.**\n",
      "4. **Difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly.**\n",
      "5. **Often \"on the go,\" acting as if \"driven by a motor.\"**\n",
      "6. **Talks excessively.**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Impulsivity:\n",
      "1. **Blurts out answers before questions have been completed.**\n",
      "2. **Difficulty waiting their turn.**\n",
      "3. **Interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations or games).**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Symptoms:\n",
      "1. **Difficulty with executive functioning (e.g., planning, prioritizing, and organizing).**\n",
      "2. **Emotional dysregulation (e.g., mood swings, irritability).**\n",
      "3. **Restlessness or feeling on edge.**\n",
      "4. **Difficulty with time management.**\n",
      "5. **Procrastination and difficulty starting tasks.**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Diagnostic Criteria:\n",
      "- **Age of Onset:** Symptoms must be present before the age of 12.\n",
      "- **Duration and Frequency:** Symptoms must be present in multiple settings (e.g., home, school, work) and must interfere with or reduce the quality of social, academic, or occupational functioning.\n",
      "- **Severity:** Symptoms must be severe enough to cause significant impairment in daily life.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Types of ADHD:\n",
      "1. **Predominantly Inattentive Presentation:** Difficulty staying focused, following instructions, and completing tasks, but without significant hyperactivity or impulsivity.\n",
      "2. **Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation:** Excessive movement and impulsivity, but without significant inattention.\n",
      "3. **Combined Presentation:** Both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity are present.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n",
